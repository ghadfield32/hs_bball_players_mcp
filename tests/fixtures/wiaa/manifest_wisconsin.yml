# Wisconsin WIAA Fixture Manifest
#
# This file defines the complete coverage grid for Wisconsin WIAA basketball fixtures.
# It serves as the single source of truth for:
# - What years/genders/divisions we want to cover (coverage goals)
# - Which fixtures are present (have HTML files)
# - Which fixtures are planned (Priority 1/2 expansion)
# - Which fixtures are unavailable or out of scope
#
# Fixture file naming convention:
#   {year}_Basketball_{gender}_{division}.html
#
# Example:
#   2024_Basketball_Boys_Div1.html
#
# Status values:
#   - present: Fixture file exists and is validated
#   - planned: Scheduled for acquisition (Priority 1 or 2)
#   - future: Not yet scheduled but within coverage scope
#   - unavailable: Outside coverage scope or doesn't exist on WIAA site
#
