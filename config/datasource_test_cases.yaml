# Datasource Test Cases Configuration
#
# Known-good player + season combinations per datasource for semantic validation.
# These should be manually verified on the source website before adding.
#
# Structure:
#   datasource_name:
#     - player_name: "Full Player Name"
#       season: "2023-24" or "2023"
#       team_hint: "Team Name" (optional, helps with search)
#       expected_min_games: 1 (minimum games expected)
#       expected_min_ppg: 5.0 (optional, minimum PPG expected)
#       expected_max_ppg: 50.0 (optional, maximum PPG expected)
#       notes: "Any special notes about this test case"
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/validate_datasource_stats.py
#
# Notes:
# - Keep 2-5 test cases per datasource
# - Use real player names verified on the source website
# - expected_* fields are optional; sanity checks alone help
# - Test cases drive production validation, so choose carefully
