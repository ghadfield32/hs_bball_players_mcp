# Datasource Status Configuration
#
# This file provides the canonical view of all configured datasources including:
# - Legal/access status (ToS, robots.txt compliance)
# - Implementation status (green/wip/todo/blocked)
# - Data capabilities (what stats are actually available)
# - Historical coverage (which seasons are supported)
#
# Status values:
#   - green: Production-ready with tests and validation
#   - wip: Work in progress, partially implemented
#   - todo: Planned but not started
#   - blocked: Cannot proceed (legal, paywall, or technical blocker)
#
# Access modes:
#   - official_api: Documented public API or data feed
#   - public_html: Public HTML pages, ToS allows scraping
#   - partnership_needed: Requires license or data partnership
#   - blocked: Anti-bot protection, ToS prohibits scraping
#
# Anti-bot levels:
#   - none: Standard HTTP requests work
#   - moderate: Some protection, browser automation may help
#   - heavy: Cloudflare/Akamai, requires sophisticated bypass
